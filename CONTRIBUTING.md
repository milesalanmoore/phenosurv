# Contributing to phenosurv

Thanks for helping build phenosurv! This guide covers setting up a local development environment and how we write code here: tests first.

## Local setup

We use [pixi](https://pixi.sh) to manage the development environment. One command installs Python, [CmdStan](https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/) (including the C++ compiler it needs) and every other dependency, at the exact versions recorded in `pixi.lock`. You don't need conda, a virtual environment or `cmdstanpy.install_cmdstan()`.

1. **Install pixi** (once per computer):

   - macOS / Linux:
     ```sh
     curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
     ```
   - Windows (PowerShell):
     ```powershell
     powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
     ```

   Restart your terminal afterwards so the `pixi` command is available.

2. **Clone the repository and install the environment:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/milesalanmoore/phenosurv.git
   cd phenosurv
   pixi install
   ```
   The first install downloads CmdStan and a compiler, so it can take a few minutes. The environment lives in `.pixi/` inside the repo and doesn't affect anything else on your computer.

3. **Check that everything works:**
   ```sh
   pixi run test
   ```

### Day-to-day commands

| What | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Run all tests | `pixi run test` |
| Run one test file | `pixi run python -m unittest tests.test_thresh_surv_gdd -v` |
| Run one test | `pixi run python -m unittest tests.test_thresh_surv_gdd.TestThreshSurvGDDPrintCode.test_print_code_writes_to_stdout` |
| Open a shell inside the environment | `pixi shell` (then use `python` directly; `exit` to leave) |

phenosurv itself is installed in editable mode, so changes under `src/phenosurv/` take effect right away without reinstalling.

### Adding a dependency

- `pixi add <package>` adds a conda-forge package. Prefer this, especially for anything that needs compiled code.
- `pixi add --pypi <package>` adds a package that is only on PyPI.
- If phenosurv needs the package **at runtime** (not just for development), also add it to `dependencies` under `[project]` in `pyproject.toml`. That list is what people get when they `pip install phenosurv`.
- Commit the updated `pyproject.toml` **and** `pixi.lock` together.

## Test-driven development

phenosurv is built test-first. Every change to behavior starts with a test that fails, and code is only written to make a failing test pass. We use the standard-library [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) framework.

### The cycle: red → green → refactor

1. **Red.** Write a small test for the next behavior you want. Run it and **watch it fail**, and check that it fails for the reason you expect (for example `ImportError: cannot import name 'ThreshSurvGDD'`, not a typo). A test you've never seen fail might not be testing anything.
2. **Green.** Write the simplest code that makes the test pass. Resist adding features that no test asks for yet.
3. **Refactor.** With all tests passing, clean up names, duplication and structure. Rerun the tests after each change.

Then pick the next behavior and repeat.

### What makes a good test here

- **Test behavior, not implementation.** Check what a user of phenosurv sees: return values, printed output, raised errors. Don't assert on how the code calls cmdstanpy internally, so the implementation can change without rewriting tests.
- **One behavior per test**, with a name that says what it checks: `test_can_instantiate_without_data` beats `test_model_2`. When a test fails, its name should tell you what broke.
- **Keep tests fast.** Compiling a Stan model or running MCMC takes seconds to minutes. Most tests should check behavior that doesn't need either, so the whole suite stays quick enough to run after every change.
- **Bug fixes start with a test.** Before fixing a bug, write a test that reproduces it and fails. The fix is done when that test passes, and the test keeps the bug from coming back.

### Where tests go

- Library code lives in `src/phenosurv/`; tests live in `tests/`.
- Test files are named `test_<thing>.py` (for example `tests/test_thresh_surv_gdd.py`) so `unittest` discovers them automatically.
- Group related tests in `unittest.TestCase` classes, and use `setUp` for shared setup.

## Submitting changes

1. Create a branch for your work: `git switch -c short-description`.
2. Work through red → green → refactor, committing as you go.
3. Make sure `pixi run test` passes.
4. Open a pull request against `main`. In the description, link the issue it addresses (for example `Closes #2`) and summarize the behavior the new tests cover.
